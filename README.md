# Matrix Factorization

Matrix Factorization via alternating least squares, including Tikhonov, L1- and L2 regularization. The L1 regularization problem (similar to LASSO) is solved via 'alternating stochastic iterative soft-thresholding algorithm' (SISTA üíÅ) and the L0 problem with the hard thresholding algorithm, though this problem is not convex.
